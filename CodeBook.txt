This file describes the column labels in myTidyData.txt.

The following measurements come from accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial signals captured and processed from a smartphone.  Each have X, Y, and Z directions and were summarized by taking the mean and standard deviation of each (42 variables of the pattern “tGravityAcc.mean…X”).

                  "tGravityAcc",
                  "tBodyAccJerk",
                  "tBodyGyro",
                  "tBodyGyroJerk",
                  "fBodyAcc",
                  "fBodyAccJerk",
                  "fBodyGyro")

There are eight (8) additional  variables that have mean and standard deviation calculations but no corresponding axial direction.  They take the pattern “tGravityAccMag.mean..” and are:

                   "tGravityAccMag",
                   "tBodyAccJerkMag",
                   "tBodyGyroMag",
                   "tBodyGyroJerkMag",
                   "fBodyAccMag",
                   "fBodyBodyAccJerkMag", 
                   "fBodyBodyGyroMag", 
                   "fBodyBodyGyroJerkMag"

Finally there are two additional variables used for identifying the subject and their corresponding activity while moving with the smartphone.  These are:

                   “subject”
                   “activity”
